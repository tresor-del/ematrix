            <ul>
                <li>Information you give us. For example, our service requires you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, and telephone number.</li>
                <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content.</li>

                <li>For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of our company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</li>
