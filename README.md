## Introduction

This is a task management web application based on the Eisenhower Matrix, designed to help users prioritize and organize their tasks and projects effectively.

As mentioned, the app uses the Eisenhower Matrix, which means users can categorize their tasks into four distinct quadrants:

1. ### Urgent and Important

2. ### Not Urgent but Important

3. ### Urgent but Not Important

4. ### Neither Urgent nor Important

This structure helps users focus on what truly matters, delegate less critical tasks, and eliminate distractions.
