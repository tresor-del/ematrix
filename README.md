# eMatrix

## Introduction

This is a task management web application based on the Eisenhower matrix, designed to help users prioritize and organize their tasks and projects efficiently.

---

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness

This project satisfies the distinctiveness requirement because it is not a simple clone of common projects like a blog or a to-do list. Instead, it introduces a unique feature set, such as:

- **Integration of the Eisenhower Matrix:** A decision-making framework for prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance.
- **User-specific analytics:** Visual feedback on productivity and time management trends.

### Complexity

This project meets the complexity requirement due to:

1. **Advanced Backend Logic**: Includes custom models and queries to handle relationships between users, tasks, notifications, and projects.
2. **Dynamic Frontend**: Utilizes JavaScript for real-time updates, drag-and-drop functionality, and AJAX requests.
3. **Third-party Integrations**: Incorporates additional tools and APIs, such as charts for data visualization or authentication using social login.
